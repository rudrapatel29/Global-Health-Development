# **Global Health Expenditure Analysis (WHO)**

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Global Health Expenditure Database from the World Health Organization (WHO). The analysis explores key trends, insights, and disparities in global health spending across countries and regions, focusing on several important metrics such as **Current Health Expenditure (CHE)**, **Domestic General Government Health Expenditure (GGHE-D)**, and **Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPS)**. The dataset is sourced from the WHO Global Health Expenditure Database: [WHO Database](https://apps.who.int/nha/database/Select/Indicators/en).

## **Project Overview**
The project investigates how global health expenditure varies across different regions, countries, and income groups, and the implications of these variations on healthcare systems and access. Through data cleaning, exploration, visualizations, and dashboards, this repository provides insights into the relationships between different forms of health spending and economic conditions.

### **Key Terms Used**
- **Current Health Expenditure (CHE)**: This refers to the total amount of health expenditure in a country as a percentage of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It includes expenditures by both public and private sources on healthcare services and goods.
  
- **Domestic General Government Health Expenditure (GGHE-D)**: This term refers to the percentage of a country's GDP spent on health services by the general government. It includes spending from government budgets and social health insurance funds.

- **Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPS)**: This is the direct payment made by individuals to healthcare providers at the time of service use. It typically includes costs not covered by insurance, such as copayments or services excluded from insurance coverage.

- **External Health Expenditure**: External resources for health refer to the funds or assistance that a country receives from foreign governments or international organizations to support its healthcare system.

- **Private Health Expenditure**: This refers to the total healthcare expenditure that is funded through private sources, including private insurance, non-governmental organizations, and out-of-pocket expenses by individuals.

- **Health Expenditure per Capita**: This metric represents the average health spending per person in a given country or region.

### **Key Analyses**
- **CHE as a percentage of GDP**: Examines countries with the highest and lowest health expenditures relative to their economies.
- **Regional Health Expenditure**: Compares Domestic General Government Health Expenditure (GGHE-D) across regions like Europe, Africa, and the Western Pacific Region.
- **Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPS)**: Analyzes the burden on individuals across income groups and the disparities in access to healthcare.
- **External Health Expenditure**: Investigates how lower-income regions rely on external funding for healthcare services.
- **Health Spending Over Time**: Tracks changes in government and private health spending across different income levels and regions over the years.

## **Interactive Dashboard**
An **interactive Power BI dashboard** has been created to visualize the key insights derived from the analysis, making it easier to explore regional and country-specific health expenditure data.

### **Dashboard Highlights**:
1. **Current Health Expenditure as % of GDP by Region**: Western Pacific (WPR), Europe (EUR), and the Americas (AMR) have the highest health expenditures relative to GDP.
2. **Current Health Expenditure per Capita**: The United States, Switzerland, and Norway lead in per capita health spending.
3. **Private vs. Government Health Expenditure Over the Years**: Demonstrates the evolution of government and private sector contributions to healthcare from 2000 to 2020.
4. **External Health Expenditure Trends**: Displays the increasing reliance on external contributions in low-income regions.
5. **Average Out-of-Pocket Expenditure by Region**: Shows the burden of out-of-pocket costs, especially in countries like Yemen and Uzbekistan, where individuals pay a higher percentage of their GDP on healthcare.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, etc.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Removing inconsistencies, handling missing data, and ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Correlation and causation analysis to explore relationships between different health expenditure metrics.

## **Conclusion**
The analysis reveals significant disparities in health expenditure globally, with wealthier countries and regions generally investing more in healthcare relative to GDP, while lower-income regions often depend on external contributions. The insights gained from this project highlight the importance of health funding strategies tailored to regional needs and economic capabilities.
